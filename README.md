# Tomorrow Graphing Calculator
![Example Screenshot](tomorrow_screenshot_usage.png)
A small learning project to develop a simple, 2D, cross-platform graphing calculator. You give it some functions, it gives you a plot of that function - that's all that we're going for at the moment.

We're all new devs, and we welcome anyone who's interested in contributing - say hi, ask questions, help out on some issues - we try not to bite.
